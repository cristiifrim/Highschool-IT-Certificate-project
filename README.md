### High school IT certificate project

---

This project represents my work for the certificate that the high school I finished gives for students that want to work in the IT area.

The subject of this project was Object Oriented Programming. Basically, this website presents the principles of OOP and has three examples of how classes and objects are used in C++.

The focus was on the structure of the page and the HTML/CSS code, not in the content displayed on the web site.
